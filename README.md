# NBA Analytics Sharing
I created a separate github repo just for the the 13th Feb, 2018 PyData SG Meetup Sharing. My original repo is just too much messy, and sharing that would most probably confuse more than inform. All code are kept in Jupyter notebooks, and written in Python 2.7. 

The files found in this repo include:

1. Main baseline model that was trained with my NBA data, saved as a Python Object
2. Web scraping script to update my current season data. 
3. Script to execute the daily predictions
4. Dashboard that shows the results of my predictions.
5. Other random scripts that I might show if I have too much time left.

The actual csv files are of course, not found in the repo.
